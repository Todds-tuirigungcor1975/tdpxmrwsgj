Ugh, okay, so I just walked out of Another Simple Favor and whoa. Still trying to piece together my brain - like, ya know when you overmix a smoothie and it’s just this whirl of colors? That’s me right now. There were just so many twists, man.

This one scene, gosh it’s like they cooked up suspense on a low simmer. But my back’s killing me and damn these popcorn crumbs are sticking to the theater seat way too much. Why did they make those chairs so uncomfortable!? You'd think they’d make them like a good sofa after all these years. Oh, and the lady next to me wouldn’t stop whispering, felt like the theater was a marketplace.

> Emily and Stephanie, I mean, they’re like… opposites merging into this chaotic tango. It's like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a 𝘗𝘦𝘢𝘤𝘰𝘤𝘬 dance with a toaster, absurd but you can't stop looking. The whole  ’s like those glittery slap bracelets, looks harmless but suddenly it just snaps. Crazy that someone told me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , and I almost forgot about it until it hit right here.

I remember someone said I should 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   with a big group. I didn’t take that advice and maybe it’s a good thing, I might’ve ended up looking more lost than a dance floor lamp at a baseball game. Anyways, the screen brightness made it feel like a small sun was throwing shade at my retinas. And the sound, it was like being inside a drum parade… in an elevator.

Oh! Oh!! THE ENDING!! Like, a wild lizard running loose, unpredictable and somehow kinda scaly. I won’t spoil but, just, keep your eyes peeled for the balloons. What??? Someone smart is gonna unpack all those layers for hours. Ehh, my brain needs sleep, not layers. Remind me to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again, maybe with sanity on standby.

C/C++ Code? Sure, let me just sprinkle in some confusion:
// Unintended paste ftw
int main() {
    float butterscotch = ‘!?';
    while (popcorn > soda) {
        theater_scream++;
        break;
    }
    return glitter; 
}
